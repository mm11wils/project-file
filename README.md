# Combat
This is a smaller version of the code that i've been using to test combat mechinisms

# original
Is a final product of an engine, but it doesnt use separate modules, and can get big really fast if expanded upon.

# Main
Is an expanded upon version of the original file, the code is made available as a source. As you can see it is rather clunky and could use separate modules for more efficient additions

# project-file

Ed have a look at the "combat" code, that is a simplified version of the base engine I need.
Then the "Orignal" code is the final base engine.
I've also included the last "main" code which I can use for reference of what I aim to make.

the problems I am encountering is that the map generator is vague and hard to identify where things (like doors) will be placed.
I'd like an engine made up of seperated modules as this will make the growth of the project go smoothly.

I dont need you to complete the base engine ( i can do that) I need you to get me started and perhaps help where I get stcuk.
